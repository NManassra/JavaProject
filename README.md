# JavaProject
This project was developed using Java and JavaFX. I created a Pizza System that interacts with customers through the JavaFX user interface. It calculates the cost based on the number of pizzas, size, delivery region (for the delivery person), and the desired pizza flavor. These calculations are performed using Java.
